            On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I gave notice to the Speaker of a point of order that I was asked to raise. I was fortunate to have the 1 pm to 1.30 pm slot in Westminster Hall for a debate on the situation in Serbia and Kosovo. When I went into that Chamber at 12.50 pm, it was stuffy, smelly and airless. It is no exaggeration to say&#x2014;and others agreed with me&#x2014;that it smelt like a rather full school pupils' changing room. There may be a ventilation problem, but my point is that it is no place for the House of Commons to conduct its official business.</p><p>
            I ask members of the Speaker's Office and the Office of the Serjeant at Arms to go and not just see but smell for themselves. I am not casting aspersions on the school parties that were present; my point concerns the nature of what we have set up in that place. It is totally unsuitable for prolonged parliamentary activity, at least while it remains as airless as it is now. Could the House authorities examine the matter?

            Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I, too, was in Westminster Hall today. I must admit that I did not smell anything, but perhaps I had left when the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) arrived.</p><p>
            The hon. Gentleman asked you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, to make representations to Madam Speaker. Two debates took place in Westminster Hall this morning. One concerned post offices, and a good many people were interested and wanted to sit in the Public Gallery; the other dealt with petrol retailing, and a large number of petrol retailers had come to listen. In fact, the public area was not sufficient for the number of people who turned up. Only a few could go in at a time, for half an hour at a time, so no one had a chance to hear the whole debate. Perhaps that too could be mentioned in your representations.

            I suggest that concerns about ventilation and housekeeping should be directed to the Serjeant at Arms. Hon. Members with concerns about management and arrangements generally in the new Chamber should contact the Chairman of the Modernisation Committee.
